# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-Model
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning modeling effort aimed at predicting median house values in California. Using a dataset that includes various metrics such as geographical coordinates, housing age, room counts, and more, we have constructed a predictive model to estimate housing prices in different districts.
