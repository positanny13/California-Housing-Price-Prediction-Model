# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-Model
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning modeling effort aimed at predicting median house values in California. Using a dataset that includes various metrics such as geographical coordinates, housing age, room counts, and more, we have constructed a predictive model to estimate housing prices in different districts. 

The project encompasses the following key tasks:

Data Preprocessing: We start by loading and exploring the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: We extract the target variable (median income) and encode categorical variables using label encoding.

Model Building: Three different regression models are trained on the dataâ€”Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of each model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a metric.

Model Selection: Based on the MSE results, we identify the Random Forest Regressor as the best-performing model for predicting housing prices in California.

The project showcases essential data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and a comparative analysis of different regression models.
